# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

This project implements real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces in real-time, and displays the video feed with bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected faces in a video stream.
- Press `q` to quit the program.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Python 3.6 or above
2. OpenCV library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
